This Project will follow the six step data analysis process: 
### ❓ [Ask](#1-ask)

### 🛠 [Process](#3-process)
### 📊 [Analyze](#4-analyze)
### 📋 [Share](#5-share)
### 🧗‍♀️ [Act](#6-act)


## 1. Ask 
An app store is any digital storefront intended to allow search and review of software titles or other media offered for sale electronically. My client is an aspiring app developer who has asked me to run an analysis on which applications perform the best, in order to decide for himself which app niche he should invest his time to enter. I will aim to answer my clients most common questions, those of which include: 
 - What app categories are most popular?
 - What price should I set?
 - How can I maximise user ratings?
Currently the stakeholders that I must account for are:
 - The client
 - The clients customers
 - The appstore community

## 2. Prepare (aka Exploratory Data Analysis)
Step 1: I will check the number of unique apps in both data sets (AppleStore and appleStore_description_combined). This is done as a discrepancy in either table would mean that the data set is not clean and thus has the potential to negatively impact our in depth analysis.
